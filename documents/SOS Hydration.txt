Section 1.       Authorized Capital Stock.         Common Stock may be issued from time to time by the Corporation for such consideration as shall be determined by the board of directors of the Corporation. The capital stock of the Corporation, after the consideration therefor has been fully paid, shall not be assessable for any purpose, and no stock issued as fully paid shall ever be assessable or assessed, and these Articles of Incorporation (as the same may be further amended from time to time, the “Articles of Incorporation”) shall not be amended in this particular. No stockholder of the Corporation shall be individually liable for the debts or liabilities of the Corporation.
 
Section 2.       Common Stock.

No holder of Common Stock shall have the right to cumulate votes. The holders of Common Stock shall not have any conversion, redemption or preemptive rights. Except as otherwise required by the NRS, holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to the Articles of Incorporation. Except as otherwise provided by the Articles of Incorporation or the NRS, the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends when, as and if declared by the board of directors of the Corporation out of assets legally available therefor.

Section 2.       Classified Board.             Upon the effectiveness of the Corporation’s registration statement on Form S-1 with respect to its initial public offering of common stock, the directors shall be classified, with respect to the time for which they shall hold their respective offices, by dividing them into three classes, to be known as "Class I," "Class II" and "Class III." Directors of Class I shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders after such effectiveness and until their successors are elected and qualified, directors of Class II shall hold office until the second annual meeting of stockholders after such effectiveness and until their successors are elected and qualified and directors of Class III shall hold office until the third annual meeting of stockholders after such effectiveness and until their successors are elected and qualified. At each annual meeting of stockholders following such effectiveness, successors to the directors of the class whose term of office expires at such annual meeting shall be elected to hold office until the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders, so that the term of office of only one class of directors shall expire at each annual meeting. The number of directors in each class, which shall be such that as near as possible to one-third and at least one-fourth (or such other fraction as required by the NRS) in number are elected at each annual meeting, shall be established from time to time by resolution of the board of directors and shall be increased or decreased by resolution of the board of directors, as may be appropriate whenever the total number of directors is increased or decreased.
 
Section 3.       Limitation of Liability.     The liability of directors and officers of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the NRS.

Section 4.       Payment of Expenses.      In addition to any other rights of indemnification permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada or as may be provided for by the Corporation in its bylaws or by agreement, the expenses of officers and directors incurred in defending any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding (including without limitation, an action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, involving alleged acts or omissions of such officer or director in his or her capacity as an officer or director of the Corporation or as an officer or director of a predecessor corporation or affiliate of such corporation; or member, manager, or managing member of a predecessor limited liability company or affiliate of such limited liability company or while serving in any capacity at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, agent, member, manager, managing member, partner, or fiduciary of, or in any other capacity for, another corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, shall be paid by the Corporation or through insurance purchased and maintained by the Corporation or through other financial arrangements made by the Corporation, as they are incurred and in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit or proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the officer or director to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. To the extent that an officer or director is successful on the merits in defense of any such action, suit or proceeding, or in the defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the Corporation shall indemnify him or her against expenses, including attorneys’ fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the defense. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in the bylaws, no director or officer may be indemnified for expenses incurred in defending any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding (including without limitation, an action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, that such director or officer incurred in his or her capacity as a stockholder.

Section 1.       Indemnification Against Claims of Third Parties.                     The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, except an action by or in the right of the corporation, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, advisory director, member of a committee appointed by the directors of the Corporation, or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if it is determined as provided in Section 3 of this Article that he:
 
(a) Is not liable pursuant to NRS 78.138; or
 
(b) Acted in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.
 
The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, does not, of itself, create a presumption that the person is liable pursuant to NRS 78.138 or did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or that, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, the person had reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful.
 
Section 2.       Indemnification Against Derivative Claims.      The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, advisory director, member of a committee appointed by the directors of the Corporation, or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses, including amounts paid in settlement and attorneys’ fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the defense or settlement of the action or suit if it is determined as provided in this Article, that he or she:
 
(a) is not liable pursuant to NRS 78.138; or
 
(b) acted in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation.
 
Indemnification may not be made for any claim, issue or matter as to which such person has been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom, to be liable to the Corporation or for amounts paid in settlement to the Corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which the action or suit was brought or other court of competent jurisdiction determines upon application that the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court deems proper.

Section 4.       Determination of Propriety of Indemnification. Any indemnification under Section 1 and Section 2 of this Article, unless ordered by a court or advanced by pursuant to Section 5 of this Article, may be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances. The determination may be made:
 
(a)           By the board of directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding;
 
(b)          If a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding so orders, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion; or
 
(c)           If a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding cannot be obtained, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion.
 
Section 5. Advance Payments.          Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding must be paid by the Corporation as they are incurred and in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer, to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. The provisions of this subsection do not affect any rights to advancement of expenses to which corporate personnel other than directors or officers may be entitled under any contract or otherwise by law.
 
Section 6.       Insurance.       The Corporation may, but is not required to, purchase and maintain insurance in such amounts and providing coverage on such terms as shall be reasonable to the Corporation on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article.
 
Section 7.       Miscellaneous. The indemnification provided by this Article:
 
(a)           Does not exclude any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the certificate or articles of incorporation or any agreement, vote of stockholder(s), or disinterested directors or otherwise, for either an action in his official capacity or an action in another capacity while holding his office, except that indemnification, unless ordered by a court pursuant to Section 2 or for the advancement of expenses made pursuant to Section 5, may not be made to or on behalf of any director or officer if a final adjudication establishes that his acts or omissions involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of the law and was material to the cause of action; and
