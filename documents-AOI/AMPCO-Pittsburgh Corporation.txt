As amended and restated on June 4, 2024 

ARTICLE I
SHAREHOLDERS

Section 1.	Annual Meeting. 

An annual meeting of shareholders for the election of Directors of the Corporation (each a “Director”) and the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting shall be held on such date and at such time as the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the “Board of Directors”) may designate, with such time date and time being set forth in the notice of the annual meeting provided pursuant to Section 5 of this Article I. If the date fixed for an annual meeting, or for the reconvening of an adjourned annual meeting, is a legal holiday, the meeting shall be held at the same hour on the next succeeding full business day which is not a legal holiday. 

Section 2.	Business to be Conducted at Annual Meeting. 

At an annual meeting of shareholders, only such business (other than nominations of Directors, which must be made in compliance with, and shall be exclusively governed by, Section 17 of Article II) shall be conducted as shall have been brought before the meeting (i) pursuant to the Corporation’s notice of the meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (iii) by the chairman of the meeting, or (iv) by any shareholder of the Corporation who is a shareholder of record both at the time of giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2 and at the time of the annual meeting, who shall be entitled to vote at such meeting and who shall have complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2. Clause (iv) in the immediately preceding sentence shall be the exclusive means for a shareholder to submit such business (other than matters properly brought under Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and included in the Corporation’s notice of meeting) before an annual meeting of shareholders. 

For any such business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder pursuant to this Section 2, notice in writing must be delivered or mailed by certified mail to the Secretary of the Corporation (the “Secretary”) and received at the principal offices of the Corporation not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is to be more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be received not earlier than the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than the 90th day prior to the date of such annual meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of such advanced or delayed annual meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the annual meeting is first made. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or announcement thereof commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder’s notice as described above. 

Such shareholder notice shall set forth, as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting, each of the following: 

 
 
(a)	a brief description of the business to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at such meeting, and the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and, in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend these By-Laws, the text of the proposed amendment); 

(b)	as to both the shareholder giving the notice and any Shareholder Associated Person on whose behalf the proposal is made: 

(1)	the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation’s books, of such shareholder and of each Shareholder Associated Person; 

(2)	the class or series and number of the Corporation’s securities which are owned, directly or indirectly, beneficially and of record by such shareholder and by each Shareholder Associated Person; 

(3)	any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism related to any security of the Corporation or with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of any security of the Corporation, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying security of the Corporation or otherwise (a “Derivative Instrument”) directly or indirectly owned beneficially by such shareholder or Shareholder Associated Person and any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of any security of the Corporation; 

(4)	any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions entered into by or on behalf of, or any other agreement, arrangement, or understanding (including any borrowing or lending of shares) the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss or manage risk or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such shareholder or Shareholder Associated Person with respect to any share of the Corporation; 

(i)	any proxy, contract, arrangement, understanding, or relationship pursuant to which such shareholder or Shareholder Associated Person has a right to vote any shares of any class or series of the Corporation’s capital stock; 

(ii)	any short interest of such shareholder or Shareholder Associated Person in any security of the Corporation (for purposes of this Section 2, a person shall be deemed to have a short interest in a security if such person directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise, has the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any decrease in the value of the subject security); 

(iii)	any rights to dividends on any securities of the Corporation owned beneficially by such shareholder or Shareholder Associated Person that are separated or separable from the underlying securities of the Corporation; 

(iv)	any proportionate interest in shares of any class or series of the Corporation’s capital stock or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which such shareholder or Shareholder Associated Person is a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner; 

2
 
(v)	any performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) to which such shareholder or Shareholder Associated Person is entitled based on any increase or decrease in the value of securities of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments as of the date of such notice, including any such interests held by members of the immediate family of such shareholder or Shareholder Associated Person sharing the same household (which information shall be supplemented by such shareholder and Shareholder Associated Person not later than ten (10) days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date); and 

(vi)	any other information relating to such shareholder or Shareholder Associated Person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the election of Directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; 

(vii)	any material interest of the shareholder or Shareholder Associated Person on whose behalf the proposal is made in such business; 

(viii)	a description of all agreements, arrangements and understandings between such shareholder or such Shareholder Associated Person and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business; 

(ix)	a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of capital stock of the Corporation, is entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear, in person or by proxy, at the annual meeting to propose such business; and 

(x)	a representation as to whether the shareholder or such Shareholder Associated Person is or intends to be part of a group that intends (A) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation’s outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal and/or (B) otherwise to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of such proposal. 

For purposes of these By-Laws, a “Shareholder Associated Person” of any shareholder includes (x) any person or entity controlling, directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with, the shareholder; (y) any beneficial owner of shares of the Corporation owned of record or beneficially by the shareholder; or (z) any person or entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with any person or entity described in subsections (x) or (y). 

The shareholder and any Shareholder Associated Person shall update and supplement the notice required by this Section 2 by giving notice that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice shall be true and correct (1) as of the record date for the meeting and (2) as of the date that is ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or recess thereof. Such updates and supplements shall be delivered or mailed by certified mail to the Secretary and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than five (5) business days after the record date for the meeting (in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of the record date), and (in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or recess thereof) not later than five (5) business days prior to the date for the meeting or, if practicable, any adjournment or recess thereof (and, if not practicable, on the first practicable date prior to the date to which the meeting has been adjourned or recessed). 

3
 
The Chairman of the Board of Directors (the “Chairman”) may, if the facts warrant, determine that any proposed business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2; and if the Chairman should so determine, the Chairman shall so declare to the annual meeting, and any such business shall not be transacted. A shareholder seeking to bring business before an annual meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2 shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2; provided, however, that any references in these By-Laws to the Exchange Act or the rules promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit the applicable requirements pursuant to this Section 2. Nothing in this Section 2 shall be deemed to affect any rights of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation’s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. The provisions of this Section 2 shall also govern what constitutes timely notice for purposes of Rule 14a-4(c) of the Exchange Act. 

Section 3.	Special Meetings. 

A special meeting of shareholders shall be held on such date and at such time as shall be set forth in the notice of such special meeting provided pursuant to Section 5 of this Article I. Special meetings of shareholders, other than those required by applicable law, may be called only by the Chairman or a majority of the Directors then in office. The only business to be transacted at a special meeting of shareholders shall be the business stated in the notice of such meeting. Upon the written or electronically transmitted request of the person or persons, as the case may be, who have duly called a special meeting, it shall be the duty of the Secretary to fix the date and time of the meeting, to be held not more than 60 days after the receipt of the request. 

Section 4.	Place of Meetings. 

Each annual or special meeting of shareholders shall be held at such place, either within or without the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as the Board of Directors may designate, with such place being set forth in the notice of such meeting provided pursuant to Section 5 of this Article I; provided, however, if a meeting is held by means of the Internet or other electronic communications technology in a fashion pursuant to which shareholders have the opportunity to read or hear the proceedings substantially concurrently with their occurrence, vote on matters submitted to the shareholders and pose questions to the directors, the meeting need not be held at a particular geographic location. 

Section 5.	Notice of Meetings; Waiver. 

The Secretary shall mail or electronically transmit, or cause to be mailed or electronically transmitted, notice stating the place (or if held by means of the Internet or other electronic communications technology, the means of remote communications by which shareholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting), date and time of each meeting of shareholders and, in the case of a special meeting, the general nature of the business to be transacted in accordance with any requirements set forth in the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (the “PBCL”). If such notice is mailed, it shall be deemed to have been given to a shareholder when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the shareholder at the address of such shareholder as it appears on the record of shareholders of the Corporation or supplied by such shareholder to the Corporation for the purpose of notice. Notice given by electronic transmission shall be deemed given (i) if by facsimile, when directed to a number at which the shareholder has consented to receive such notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the shareholder consented to receive such notice; (iii) if by posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the shareholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) giving of such separate notice; and (iv) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the shareholder. 

4
 
No notice of any meeting of shareholders need be given to any shareholder who properly waives notice, whether before or after the meeting and whether in writing or by electronic transmission or otherwise. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting need be specified in a waiver of notice. The attendance, in person or by proxy, of any shareholder at any meeting of shareholders shall constitute a proper waiver of notice of such meeting, except if the shareholder attends a meeting solely for the express purpose of objecting, prior to or at the commencement of such meeting, to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. 

Section 6.	Record Dates. 

The Board of Directors may fix a date and time in accordance with the PBCL as a record date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders, to receive payment of any dividend or distribution, to receive any allotment of rights or with respect to any change, conversion or exchange of shares. Only such shareholders as shall be shareholders of record at the close of business on the record date so fixed shall be entitled to notice of or to vote at such meeting, to receive payment of such dividend or distribution, to receive such allotment of rights or to exercise rights in respect to any change, conversion or exchange of shares, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the Corporation after the record date fixed as aforesaid. 

Section 7.	Quorum. 

Except as otherwise provided or permitted by applicable law or the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation (as amended, the “Articles of Incorporation”), the presence, in person or by proxy, of shareholders entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes which all shareholders are entitled to cast on a particular matter to be acted upon shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of acting upon such matter at a meeting of shareholders. If a quorum is not present, in person or by proxy, at a meeting of shareholders, those present may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at such date, time and place as they may determine. The shareholders present at any duly organized meeting of shareholders may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of sufficient shareholders to otherwise render the remaining shareholders less than a quorum. 

Section 8.	Voting. 

Except as otherwise required by applicable law or the Articles of Incorporation, shareholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock owned by them as reflected on the books of the Corporation and entitled to vote at the particular meeting of shareholders at which the shareholder is present, in person or by proxy. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote on a particular matter (and, if any shareholders are entitled to vote thereon as a class, upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote as a class) at a meeting of shareholders at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the shareholders with respect to such matter. At each meeting of shareholders at which Directors are to be elected, provided a quorum is present thereat, the Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes validly cast in such election. Shareholders shall be entitled to cumulative voting rights in the election of Directors to the extent permitted by the PBCL. The Chairman shall fix and announce at each meeting of shareholders the date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the shareholders will act at such meeting. 

5
 
Section 9.	Voting by Ballot. 

No vote of the shareholders need be taken by written ballot or conducted by Inspectors of Election, unless otherwise required by applicable law. Any vote of the shareholders which need not be taken by ballot may be conducted in any manner approved by the Chairman. If authorized by the Board of Directors, a ballot may be submitted by electronic transmission, provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the shareholder or proxyholder. 

Section 10.	Adjournments. 

At any meeting of shareholders, only the Chairman or the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereat, present, in person or by proxy, shall have the power to adjourn such meeting to another date, time or place or by means of the Internet or other electronic communication technology, without notice other than announcement at the meeting of the date, time and place, if any, at which such meeting will be reconvened and the means of electronic communication technology, if any, by which shareholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting; provided, however, any notice required by applicable law shall be given. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted on the original date of the meeting. 

Section 11.	Proxies. 

Any shareholder entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such shareholder by proxy. A shareholder may authorize a valid proxy in any manner permitted by applicable law, including by executing a written instrument executed by such shareholder, or by causing such shareholder’s signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means, including by facsimile signature or by transmitting or authorizing an electronic transmission to the person designated as the holder of the proxy, a proxy solicitation firm or a like authorized agent. No such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after the expiration of three years from the date of such proxy, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the shareholder executing it, unless such proxy is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power and except in any other case in which applicable law provides that such a proxy shall be irrevocable. A shareholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by giving notice of such revocation in writing or by electronic transmission to the Secretary or the designated agent of the Secretary. Proxies authorized by electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the shareholder. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of a writing or electronic transmission created pursuant to this Section 11 may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or electronic transmission, as the case may be, for any and all purposes for which the original writing or electronic transmission, as the case may be, could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or electronic transmission, as the case may be. Every proxy shall be filed with or transmitted to the Secretary or the Corporation’s designated agent. 

Any shareholder directly or indirectly soliciting proxies from other shareholders must use a proxy card color other than white, which shall be reserved for exclusive use by the Corporation.

6
 
Section 12.	Organization; Procedure. 

At every meeting of shareholders, the Chairman shall preside over the meeting, or, in the case of a vacancy in office or absence of the Chairman, one of the following persons present, in the order stated, shall preside: any presiding officer designated by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 12 of Article III of these By-Laws, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the vice presidents in their order of earliest election to that office, or a person chosen by vote of the shareholders present. The Secretary, or, in the event of his absence or disability, an Assistant Secretary, or if there no Assistant Secretary is present thereat then an appointee of the presiding officer at the meeting, shall act as secretary of the meeting. The order of business and all other matters of procedure at every meeting of shareholders shall be determined by such presiding officer. 

Section 13.	Inspectors of Election. 

Before each meeting of shareholders, the Chairman or any officer of the Corporation designated by resolution of the Board of Directors shall appoint one or more Inspectors of Election (each an “Inspector”) for the meeting. If any of the Inspectors shall fail to attend or refuse or be unable to serve, a substitute shall be appointed by the Chairman. An Inspector may be an employee of the Corporation and shall have such duties as are provided by applicable law. Upon request by the Chairman, an Inspector shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of an Inspector of Election with strict impartiality and according to the best of such person’s ability. 

Section 14.	Voting Lists. 

The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders. The list shall be arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each shareholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each shareholder; provided, however, that, subject to applicable law, the Corporation shall not be required to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information for shareholders on such list. The list shall be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting of shareholders and shall be subject to the inspection of any shareholder during such meeting for the purposes thereof. The Board of Directors also may elect to make the list available at such other times and by such other means as permitted by applicable law. If the Board of Directors determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to shareholders of the Corporation. If a meeting of shareholders is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list also shall be open to the examination of any shareholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting of shareholders. The list shall presumptively determine the identity of the shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares that each such shareholder may vote at the meeting. 

Section 15.	Participation in Meetings by Electronic Means. 

The Chairman may permit, on such conditions as may be determined by him, one or more shareholders or proxyholders to participate in a meeting of shareholders, count for the purposes of determining a quorum thereat and exercise all rights and privileges to which such person or persons might be entitled were such person or persons, as the case may be, personally in attendance at such meeting (including the right to vote or to consent to or dissent from any action) by means of conference telephone or other electronic means, including the Internet. Unless the Board of Directors so permits by resolution or the Chairman so permits, no person may participate in a meeting of shareholders by means of a conference telephone or other electronic means, including the Internet. 

7
 
Section 16.	No Consent of Shareholders in Lieu of Meeting. 

No action, including the authorization of any business or the expression of consent or dissent to any corporate action, may be taken by the shareholders of the Corporation without a meeting, whether by written consent or otherwise, except by the unanimous consent of all holders of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote upon such action. 

ARTICLE II
BOARD OF DIRECTORS 

Section 1.	General Powers. 

Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation or these By-laws, the Board of Directors shall manage or direct the management of the property, affairs and business of the Corporation, and the Board of Directors may exercise all the powers of the Corporation. In addition to the powers and authorities expressly conferred upon it by these By-Laws, the Board of Directors may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws directed or required to be exercised or done solely by the shareholders of the Corporation. 

Section 2.	Number and Terms of Office. 

The number of members of the Board of Directors shall be fixed in the manner specified in the Articles of Incorporation. Directors shall serve for such terms as are specified in the Articles of Incorporation. A Director shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which he was elected and until his successor shall be elected and qualified, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. 

Section 3.	Vacancies. 

Except as set forth in Section 5 of this Article II, vacancies in the Board of Directors, including vacancies resulting from an increase in the number of members of the Board of Directors, shall be filled in the manner specified in the Articles of Incorporation. 

Section 4.	Resignations. 

Any Director may resign at any time by delivering a notice of resignation in writing or by electronic transmission to the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer or the Secretary. Unless otherwise specified therein, such a resignation shall take effect upon delivery. 

Section 5.	Removal of Directors. 

Any Director may be removed at any time by shareholder vote as specified in the Articles of Incorporation. Any vacancy in the Board of Directors caused by any such removal may be filled at such meeting by the shareholders entitled to vote for the election of the Director so removed. If such shareholders do not fill such a vacancy at such meeting, the vacancy may be filled in the manner provided in Section 3 of this Article II. The repeal of any provision of the Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws prohibiting, or the addition of any provision to the Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws permitting, the removal by the shareholders of the Board of Directors, a class of the Board of Directors or any one or more Directors without assigning any cause shall not apply to any incumbent Director during the balance of the term for which he was elected. 

8
 
Section 6.	Annual Meeting. 

An annual meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held each year as soon as practicable after the annual meeting of shareholders, at the place where such meeting of shareholders was held or on such other date and at such other time and place, either within or without the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as the Board of Directors may designate, for the purposes of organization, election of officers and the transaction of such other business as shall come before the meeting. 

Section 7.	Regular Meetings. 

The Board of Directors from time to time may, by resolution, provide for the holding of regular meetings. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held on such dates and at such times and places, either within or without the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as the Board of Directors may designate. Notice of regular meetings need not be given; provided, however, that if the Board of Directors shall fix or change the time or place of any regular meeting, notice of such action shall be given by regular mail, electronic mail or other means of electronic transmission, telephone or personal delivery to each Director who shall not have been present at the meeting at which such action was taken. Any Director who submits a waiver of notice in writing or by electronic transmission to the Secretary before or after such meeting or attends the first regular meeting after such action is taken without protesting, prior to or at the commencement of such meeting, the lack of notice to him of the prior regular meeting, shall be deemed to have waived notice of such action to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting need be specified in a waiver of notice. 

Section 8.	Special Meetings. 

Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called only by the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer or a majority of the Directors in office, to be held on such date, at such time as will permit the giving of notice as provided in this Section 8, and at such place, either within or without the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as may be designated by the person or persons, as the case may be, calling the meeting, as the case may be.

An officer of the Corporation shall not be personally liable for monetary damages for any action taken, or any failure to take any action in his or her capacity as such; provided, however, that this provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of an officer to the extent that such elimination or limitation of liability is expressly prohibited by the PBCL as in effect at the time of the alleged action or failure to take action by such officer; provided further, however, that this Section 13 shall only apply to officers of the Corporation after this Section 13 to these By-Laws is approved by the shareholders of the Corporation in accordance with Pennsylvania law (the “Section 1735 Shareholder Approval”).

This Section 13 shall apply to any breach of performance of duty or any failure of performance of duty by any officer of the Corporation occurring after the Section 1735 Shareholder Approval is obtained. Any repeal or modification of this Section 13 shall not adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or modification to which any officer or former officer of the Corporation may be entitled under this Section 13. The rights conferred by this Section 13 shall continue as to any person who 

20
 
has ceased to be an officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs of any officer or former officer of the Corporation and the executors and administrators of the estate of any officer or former officer of the Corporation.

ARTICLE IV
CAPITAL STOCK 

Section 1.	Certificates of Stock. 

The shares of the capital stock of the Corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of the stock of the Corporation shall be uncertificated shares evidenced by registration in book-entry accounts. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until each certificate is surrendered to the Corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the Board of Directors, every holder of stock in the Corporation represented by certificates and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation, by the Chief Executive Officer, the President or a Vice President, and by the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary, representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Such certificate shall be in such form as the Board of Directors may determine, to the extent consistent with applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation and these By-Laws. 

All signatures on such certificate may be a facsimile, engraved or printed, to the extent permitted by applicable law. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed, or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon, a certificate shall have ceased to hold such office, or to be such transfer agent or registrar, as the case may be, before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. 

Section 2.	Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. 

The Board of Directors may direct that a new certificate be issued or an appropriate book-entry be recorded in place of any certificate previously issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon delivery to the Board of Directors of an affidavit of the owner or owners of such certificate, setting forth such allegation. The Board of Directors may require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to post with the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of any such new certificate or the recording of any such appropriate book-entry. 

Section 3.	Transfer of Stock. 

Upon surrender to the Corporation or the transfer agent of the Corporation of a certificate for shares, duly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, the Corporation shall issue a new certificate to the person or persons, as the case may be, entitled thereto or record the succession, assignment or transfer by appropriate book-entry procedures, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books. Within a reasonable time after the transfer of uncertificated stock, the Corporation shall send to the registered owner thereof a written notice containing the information required to be set forth or stated on certificates pursuant to applicable laws. Subject to the provisions of applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation and these By-Laws, the Board of Directors may prescribe such additional rules and regulations as it may deem appropriate relating to the issue, transfer and registration of shares of the Corporation. 

21
 
Section 4.	Registered Shareholders. 

Prior to due surrender of shares, whether or not certificated, for registration of transfer, the Corporation may treat the registered owner thereof as the person exclusively entitled to receive dividends and other distributions, to vote, to receive notice and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers of the owner of the shares represented by such certificate, and the Corporation shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or legal claim to or interest in such shares on the part of any other person, whether or not the Corporation shall have notice of such claim or interests. Whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for collateral security, and not absolutely, it shall be so expressed in the entry of the transfer if, when the certificates are presented to the Corporation for transfer or uncertificated shares are requested to be transferred, both the transferor and transferee request the Corporation to do so. 

Section 5.	Transfer Agent and Registrar. 

The Board of Directors may appoint one or more transfer agents and/or one or more registrars with respect to any class or series of the Corporation’s capital stock, and may require all certificates representing shares of such class or series to bear the signature of any such transfer agents or registrars. 

ARTICLE V
INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND OTHER PERSONS 

Section 1.	Mandatory Indemnification of Directors and Officers. 

The Corporation shall promptly indemnify, to the fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation and this Section 1, each Director or officer (including each former Director or officer) of the Corporation (hereafter, an “indemnitee”) who was or is made a party to or a witness in, or is threatened to be made a party to or a witness in, any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, investigation, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether external or internal to the Corporation (hereafter, a “proceeding”), by reason of the fact that the indemnitee is or was an authorized representative, against all expenses (including attorneys’ fees, disbursements and other charges), judgments, losses, fines (including excise taxes and penalties) and amounts paid in settlement (collectively, “Losses”) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by the indemnitee in connection with such proceeding. Indemnification pursuant to this Section 1 shall include cases in which indemnification is permitted pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 17, Subchapter D, of the PBCL. Indemnification pursuant to this Section 1 shall be made in every case described in Section 1 hereof except: 

(a)	in connection with a proceeding (or any claim, issue or matter therein or any part thereof) initiated by the indemnitee, except (1) if the Board of Directors of the Corporation has approved the initiation or bringing of such claim or (2) any compulsory counterclaim, compulsory cross-claim, or required joinder made by indemnitee in a proceeding not initiated by indemnitee; or 

(b)	with respect to any act that is established, by a final, unappealable adjudication adverse to the indemnitee, as having been material to the cause of action so adjudicated and as having constituted either willful misconduct or recklessness; or 

(c)	for liability imposed in a proceeding by or for the benefit of the Corporation to recover any profit pursuant to the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and any rules and regulations thereunder or similar provisions of any applicable state law; provided, however, that the exclusion in this clause (c) shall not apply to expenses (including attorney’s fees, disbursements and other charges) incurred by indemnitee in such a proceeding. 

22
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1, to the extent that an indemnitee is successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any proceeding or any part thereof or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, including but not limited to obtaining a dismissal without prejudice or a settlement without admission of liability, the indemnitee shall be promptly indemnified by the Corporation against all Losses actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by the indemnitee in connection therewith. 

The right of indemnification pursuant to this Section 1 is conferred in order to attract and retain the services of highly qualified Directors and officers and to encourage them to make corporate decisions without fear of strike suits and legal harassment. Indemnification pursuant to this Section 1 is therefore declared to be consistent with the fiduciary duty of the Corporation’s Board of Directors. Except as specifically provided in this Section 1, such indemnification shall be made by the Corporation without any requirement that any determination be made or any action be taken by the Board of Directors, shareholders or legal counsel of the Corporation. A failure of the Board of Directors, shareholders, or legal counsel to make a determination or take action favorable to the claim of an indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to this Section 1, or the making of a determination or taking of action adverse to such a claim, shall not preclude indemnification under this Article V or create any presumption that the indemnitee is not entitled to such indemnification. 

Section 2.	Mandatory Advancement of Expenses to Directors and Officers. 

To the fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation and these By-Laws, the Corporation shall promptly pay all expenses (including attorneys’ fees, disbursements and other charges) actually incurred by an indemnitee in defending or appearing in any proceeding described in Section 1 of this Article V in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding upon receipt of (A) an undertaking by or on behalf of the indemnitee to repay all amounts advanced if it is ultimately specifically determined by a final, unappealable adjudication that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation and (B) an irrevocable assignment to the Corporation of all payments to which the indemnitee may be or become entitled, under any policy of insurance or otherwise, in reimbursement of any such expenses paid by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance payment shall be made by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 2 if the Board of Directors reasonably and promptly determines by a majority vote of the Directors then in office who are not parties to the proceeding that, based upon the facts known to the Board of Directors at the time the determination is made, the matter is of the kind described in Section 1(a) of this Article V. 

Section 3.	Permissive Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses. 

The Corporation may, as determined by the Board of Directors from time to time: 

(a)	indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by Section 1 of this Article V, any other person who was or is made a party to or required to appear in, or is threatened to be made a party to or required to appear in, or was or is otherwise involved in, any threatened, pending or completed proceeding by reason of the fact that such person is or was an authorized representative of the Corporation, both as to action in such person’s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office or position, against all Losses actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection with such action or proceeding, with the same effect as though such person were an “indemnitee” as defined in Section 1 of this Article V; and 

(b)	pay expenses incurred by any such other person by reason of his participation in any such proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking 

23
 
by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation and to repay all amounts advanced for which he is reimbursed under any policy of insurance or otherwise, with the same effect as though such person were an “indemnitee” as defined in Section 1 of this Article V. 

Section 4.	Enforcement. 

If the Corporation refuses or fails to make any payment to an indemnitee required by this Article V, the indemnitee shall be promptly indemnified by the Corporation against expenses (including attorneys’ fees, disbursements and other charges) actually incurred by the indemnitee in connection with the successful establishment of such indemnitee’s right to indemnification or advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, in an action in a court of competent jurisdiction. 

Section 5.	General. 

Each Director or officer of the Corporation shall be deemed to act in such capacity in reliance upon such rights of indemnification and advancement of expenses as are provided in this Article V. The rights of indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article V shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaws, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested Directors, statute or otherwise, both as to action in such person’s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office or position, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be an authorized representative of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs and personal representatives of such person. Indemnification and advancement of expenses under this Article V shall be provided whether or not the indemnified liability arises or arose from any threatened, pending or completed action by or in the right of the Corporation. Any repeal or modification of this Article V shall not adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or modification to which any person may be entitled under this Article V. 

Section 6.	Definition of Corporation. 

For the purposes of this Article V, references to the “Corporation” shall include all constituent corporations absorbed in a consolidation, merger or division, as well as the surviving or new corporations surviving or resulting therefrom, so that (i) any person who is or was an authorized representative of a constituent, surviving or new corporation shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article V with respect to the surviving or new corporation as such person would if such person had served the surviving or new corporation in the same capacity and (ii) any person who is or was an authorized representative of the Corporation shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article V with respect to the surviving or new corporation as such person would with respect to the Corporation if its separate existence had continued. 

Section 7.	Definition of Authorized Representative. 

For the purposes of this Article V, the term “authorized representative” shall mean, and the indemnification provisions of this Article V shall be deemed to apply to, a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or of any subsidiary (including any former subsidiary) of the Corporation, or a trustee, custodian, administrator, committeeman or fiduciary of any employee benefit plan (including former employee benefit plan) established and maintained by the Corporation or by any direct or indirect subsidiary (including any former subsidiary) of the Corporation, or a person serving another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise in any of the foregoing capacities at the request of the Corporation. 

24
 
Section 8.	Savings Clause. 

If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Article V requires the Corporation to take an action that would violate applicable law, such provision shall be limited or modified in its application to such action to the minimum extent necessary to avoid such violation of law, and, as so limited or modified, such provision and the balance of this Article V shall be enforceable in accordance with their terms to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, including but not limited to the PBCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if some or all of the indemnification provided for in this Article V is unavailable for any reason in respect of any liability or portion thereof, the Corporation shall contribute to the liabilities to which the indemnitee may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the intent of this Article V, in proportion to the relative benefits received by the Corporation (including any subsidiary or former subsidiary of the Corporation) and all other officers, directors, and employees of the Corporation (or of any subsidiary or former subsidiary of the Corporation or other relevant enterprise described in Section 7 of this Article V) who are or would be jointly liable with the indemnitee, on the one hand, and by the indemnitee, on the other hand, and, to the extent required to conform to law, as further adjusted by reference to the relative fault of the Corporation (including any subsidiary or former subsidiary of the Corporation) and all other officers, directors, and employees of the Corporation (or of any subsidiary or former subsidiary of the Corporation or other relevant enterprise described in Section 7 of this Article V), on the one hand, and of the indemnitee, on the other hand. 

Section 9.	Insurance. 

The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was an authorized representative of the Corporation, against any liability asserted against or incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of the status of such person as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article V. 

Section 10.	Funding to Meet Indemnification Obligations. 

The Board of Directors, without approval of the shareholders of the Corporation, shall have the power to borrow money on behalf of the Corporation, including the power to pledge the assets of the Corporation, from time to time to discharge the Corporation’s obligations with respect to indemnification, the advancement and reimbursement of expenses and the purchase and maintenance of insurance referred to in this Article V. The Corporation may, in lieu of or in addition to the purchase and maintenance of insurance referred to in Section 9 of this Article V, establish and maintain a fund of any nature or otherwise secure or insure in any manner its indemnification obligations, whether arising under or pursuant to this Article V or otherwise.

Section 5.	Voting as Shareholder. 

Unless otherwise determined by resolution of the Board of Directors, each of the Chief Executive Officer, the President and any Vice President shall have full power and authority on behalf of the Corporation to attend any meeting of shareholders, unitholders, members, partners or other equity owners of any corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other legal entity in which the Corporation may hold stock or other ownership interests, and to act, vote (or execute proxies to vote) and exercise in person or by proxy all other rights, powers and privileges incident to the ownership of such stock or other ownership interest. Such officers acting on behalf of the Corporation shall have full power and authority to execute any instrument expressing consent to or dissent from any action of any such corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other legal entity without a meeting. The Board of Directors by resolution from time to time may confer such power and authority upon any other person.

To the extent not inconsistent with the emergency By-laws, the By-laws provided in the preceding Articles shall remain in effect during such emergency and upon the termination of such emergency the emergency By-laws shall cease to be operative unless and until another such emergency shall occur. 

Section 2.	Meetings. 

During any emergency contemplated by Section 1 of this Article VIII: 

(a)	Any meeting of the Board of Directors may be called by any Director. Whenever any officer of the Corporation who is not a Director has reason to believe that no Director is available to participate in a meeting, such officer may call a meeting to be held under the provisions of this Section 2.

(b)	Notice of each meeting called under the provisions of this Section 2 shall be given by the person calling the meeting or at his request by any officer of the Corporation. The notice shall specify the time and the place of the meeting, which shall be the head office of the Corporation, if feasible, and otherwise any other place, within or without the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, specified in the notice. Notice need be given only to such of the Directors as it may be feasible to reach at the time and may be given by such means as may be feasible at the time, including publication or radio. If given by mail, messenger; telephone, electronic transmission, or telegram, the notice shall be addressed to the Director at his residence, personal or business electronic mail address, business address, or such other place as the person giving the notice shall deem suitable. 

In the case of meetings called by an officer who is not a Director, notice shall also be given similarly, to the extent feasible, to the persons named on the list referred to in part (iii) of this Section 2. Notice shall be given at least two (2) days before the meeting if feasible in the judgment of the person giving the notice, and otherwise the meeting may be held on any shorter notice he shall deem suitable. 

(c)	At any meeting called under the provisions of this Section 2, the Director or Directors present shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. If no Director attends a meeting called by an officer who is not a Director and if there are present at least three (3) of the persons named on a numbered list of personnel approved by the Board of Directors before the emergency, those present (but not more than the nine (9) appearing highest in priority on such list) shall be deemed Directors for such meeting and shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. 

27
 
Section 3.	Lines of Succession. 

The Board of Directors, during as well as before any emergency contemplated by Section 1 of this Article VIII, may provide, and from time to time modify, lines of succession in the event that during such an emergency any or all officers or agents of the Corporation shall for any reason be rendered incapable of discharging their duties. 

Section 4.	Offices. 

The Board of Directors, during as well as before any emergency contemplated by Section 1 of this Article VIII, may, effective upon the occurrence of such emergency, change the head office or designate several alternative head offices or regional offices, or authorize the officers so to do.

Section 6.	Repeal or Change. 

The emergency By-laws shall be subject to repeal or change by action of the Board of Directors or by action of the shareholders, except that no such repeal or change shall modify the provisions of Section 5 of this Article VIII with regard to, action or inaction prior to the time of such repeal or change. 

ARTICLE IX
NON-APPLICABILITY OF STATUTE 

Subchapter E of Chapter 25 of the PBCL (formerly known as Section 910 of the PBCL of 1933, as amended) shall not be applicable to the Corporation. (This By-law provision was adopted by action of the Board of Directors on February 28, 1984 and may not be rescinded except by an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation.) 

Subchapters G and H of Chapter 25 of the PBCL shall not be applicable to the Corporation. (This By-law provision was adopted by action of the Board of Directors on July 20, 1990.) 

ARTICLE X
CONSTRUCTION 

In the event of any conflict between the provisions of these By-Laws as in effect from time to time and the provisions of applicable law or the Articles of Incorporation as in effect from time to time, the provisions of applicable law or the Articles of Incorporation, as the case may be, shall be controlling. Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction, and definitions in the PBCL shall govern the construction of these By-Laws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, the term “person” includes a natural person, a corporation or any other entity of any type, and the masculine gender includes the feminine gender. All restrictions, limitations, requirements and other provisions of these By-Laws shall be construed, insofar as possible, as supplemental and additional to all provisions of law applicable to the subject matter thereof and shall be fully complied with in addition to the said provisions of law unless such compliance shall be illegal. Any Article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause or phrase of these By-Laws which upon being construed in the manner provided in this Article X shall be contrary to or inconsistent with any applicable law shall not apply so long as said provisions of law shall 

28
 
remain in effect, but such result shall not affect the validity or applicability of any other portions of these By-Laws, it being hereby declared that these By-Laws would have been adopted and each article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more articles, sections, subsections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses or phrases is or are illegal. All references in these By-Laws to any statute, law, regulation or rule also shall include any successor statute, law, regulation or rule, as the case may be. All references to Articles and Sections refer to Articles and Sections of these By-Laws. The headings and subheadings in these By-Laws are for convenience only; they do not form a part of these By-Laws and shall not affect the interpretation of these By-Laws. Whenever the words “including,” “include” or “includes” are used in these By-Laws, they should be interpreted in a non-exclusive manner as though the words “without limitation” immediately followed the same. 

ARTICLE XI
FORUM SELECTION

Section 1.	Exclusive Forum. 

(a)	Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the state court of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in and for Allegheny County, the Court of Common Pleas, shall be the sole and exclusive forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation; (b) any action asserting a claim of a breach of fiduciary duty owed to the Corporation or to the Corporation’s shareholders by any director, officer, or other employee of the Corporation; (c) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, or against any director, officer, or other employee of the Corporation, arising pursuant to any provision of the Pennsylvania Associations Code, 15 Pa. C. S., the Articles of Incorporation, or these By-laws, in each case, as amended; (d) any action seeking to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of the Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws; or (e) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, or any director, officer, or other employee of the Corporation, governed by the internal affairs doctrine. If a court of competent jurisdiction finally determines that a shareholder has breached the provisions of this Section 1, then the Corporation shall be entitled to recover its reasonable legal fees and costs in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may exist at law or in equity. 

(b)	Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any securities of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this Section 1(b) of this Article XI.

Section 2.	Submission to Jurisdiction. 

Without limiting the effect of 15 Pa. C. S. § 1505, any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of the Corporation shall be deemed, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to be a “shareholder” for purposes of Section 1 of this Article XI and to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article XI. Any shareholder who initiates an action or proceeding of the type described in parts (a) through (e) of Section 1(a) of this Article XI or initiating an action or proceeding of the type described in Section 1(b) of this Article XI in a court other than a court specified in the corresponding subsection of Section 1 of this Article XI (a “Foreign Action”) shall be deemed to have consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the courts specified in the corresponding subsection of Section 1 in an action or proceeding brought in any of those courts against the shareholder to enforce Section 1 of this Article XI (an “Enforcement Action”) and (ii) having service of process in an Enforcement Action made upon the shareholder by United States mail addressed to the shareholder at the shareholder’s 

29
 
address as it appears on the records of the Corporation or upon the shareholder’s counsel in the Foreign Action by United States mail addressed to such counsel.
