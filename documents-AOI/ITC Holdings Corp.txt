OF
ITC HOLDINGS CORP.
 
Reference is made to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as assigned, the “Merger Agreement”) dated February 9, 2016 by and among FortisUS Inc. (“FortisUS”), a Delaware corporation, Fortis Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of Newfoundland and Labrador, Element Acquisition Sub Inc. (the “Merger Sub” and, until the Merger referenced below, the “Corporation”), a Michigan corporation, and ITC Holdings Corp. (“ITC”), a Michigan corporation, as assigned by that certain Assignment and Assumption Agreement, dated as of April 20, 2016, by and between FortisUS and ITC Investment Holdings Inc., a Michigan corporation, and pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into ITC (the “Merger”). Upon the effectiveness of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and ITC will be the surviving corporation in the Merger. In accordance with the Merger Agreement, these bylaws (these “Bylaws”) thereupon will become the Bylaws of ITC, as the surviving corporation, which will be, thereafter, the “Corporation” for all purposes hereunder.

CAPITAL STOCK
 
3.01          Issuance of Shares. The shares of capital stock of the Corporation (the “Shares”) shall be issued in the amounts, at the times, for the consideration, and on the terms and conditions that the Board shall deem advisable, subject to the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, any requirements of the laws of the state of Michigan and any written agreement among the Corporation and one or more Shareholders (as defined below) of the Corporation (any such agreement, a “Shareholder Agreement”).
 
3.02          Certificates for Shares. Certificated Shares shall be represented by certificates signed by one of the chairperson of the Board (the “Chairperson of the Board”), the President & CEO, or a Vice President, and also may be signed by the Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer, Secretary, or Assistant Secretary, and may be sealed with the seal of the Corporation or a facsimile of it, and countersigned and registered in such manner, if any, as the Board may by resolution prescribe. The signatures of the officers may be facsimiles if the certificate is countersigned by a transfer agent or registered by a registrar other than the corporation itself or its employee. In case an officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate ceases to be such officer before the certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he or she had not ceased to be such officer at the date of issuance. A certificate representing Shares shall state on its face that the Corporation is formed under the laws of the state of Michigan and shall also state the name of the person to whom it is issued, the number and class of Shares and the designation of the series, if any, that the certificate represents, and any other provisions, legends or notations that may be required by the laws of the state of Michigan or under any Shareholder Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may authorize the issuance of some or all of the Shares without certificates to the fullest extent permitted by law. Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of Shares without certificates, the Corporation shall send the shareholders of the Corporation (the “Shareholders”) a written statement of the information required on certificates by applicable law.
 
3.03          Transfer of Shares. Subject to the provisions of any Shareholder Agreement, certificated Shares are transferable only on the books of the Corporation by the holder thereof in person or by his or her attorney, upon surrender for cancellation of the certificate for the Shares, properly endorsed for transfer, and the presentation of the evidences of ownership and validity of the assignment that the Corporation may require. Transfers of uncertificated Shares shall be made by such evidence of ownership and validity as the Corporation or its agents may reasonably require and in compliance with the provisions of any Shareholder Agreement.
 
3.04          Registered Shareholders. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the person in whose name any Share of stock is registered as the owner of it for the purpose of dividends, other distributions, recapitalizations, mergers, plans of share exchange, reorganizations and liquidations, for the purpose of votes, approvals and consents by Shareholders, for the purpose of notices to Shareholders, and for all other purposes whatever, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in the Shares by any other person, whether or not the Corporation shall have notice of it, except as expressly required by the laws of the state of Michigan.

The Corporation may require as conditions precedent to the issuance of new certificates (a) a bond or agreement of indemnity, in the form and amount and with or without sureties, as the Board, or any officer to whom authority is delegated, may direct or approve and (b) an affidavit or affirmation setting forth such facts as to the loss, destruction or mutilation as it deems necessary.
 
3.06          Transfer Agents and Registrars. The Board may, in its discretion, appoint one or more banks or trust companies as the Board may deem advisable, from time to time, to act as transfer agents and registrars of the Shares, and upon such appointments being made, no certificate representing Shares shall be valid until countersigned by one of such transfer agents and registered by one of such registrars.

The notice shall include notice of proposals from Shareholders that are proper subjects for Shareholder action and are intended to be presented by Shareholders who have so notified the Corporation in accordance with applicable law.

No notice need be given of an adjourned meeting of the Shareholders provided that the time and place to which the meeting is adjourned are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, and at the adjourned meeting the only business to be transacted is business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. However, if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each Shareholder of record entitled to notice on the new record date as provided in this Section 4.04.

The Secretary or the agent of the Corporation having charge of the stock transfer records for Shares shall, in accordance with applicable law make and certify a complete list of the Shareholders entitled to vote at Shareholders’ meetings and provide an updated copy of such list to each Shareholder promptly upon any change thereto. The list shall be produced at the time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of any Shareholder during the entire meeting.

A complete copy, pdf, or other reliable reproduction of the proxy may be substituted or used in lieu of the original proxy for any purpose for which the original could be used. A proxy shall not be valid after the expiration of three years from its date unless otherwise provided in the proxy.

Votes may be cast orally or in writing, but if more than 25 Shareholders of record are entitled to vote, then votes shall be cast in writing signed by the Shareholder or the Shareholder’s proxy. When an action, other than the election of directors, is to be taken by a vote of the Shareholders, it shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast by the holders of Shares entitled to vote on it, unless a greater vote is required by the Articles of Incorporation or by the laws of the state of Michigan.

5.02          Number and Qualifications. Subject to the provisions of any Shareholder Agreement, the Board shall consist of not more than eleven twelve directors as shall be fixed from time to time by the Shareholders. Directors need not be residents of Michigan nor Shareholders of the Corporation. No decrease in the number of directors shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director.
 
5.03          Election, Resignation, and Removal. Directors shall be elected by the Shareholders at each annual Shareholders’ meeting in compliance with the provisions of any Shareholder Agreement. Subject to the provisions of any Shareholder Agreement, each director shall hold office until the next annual Shareholders’ meeting and until the director’s successor is elected and qualified, or until the director’s resignation or removal. Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, a director may resign by written notice to the Corporation. The resignation is effective on its receipt by the Corporation or at a subsequent time as set forth in the notice of resignation. A director may be removed, with or without cause, by the Shareholders, and thereupon the term of the director or directors who shall have been so removed shall forthwith terminate and there shall be a vacancy or vacancies in the Board, to be filled by the Shareholders. Whenever the holders of any class or series or any particular Shares are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation or any Shareholder Agreement, the provisions of this section shall apply, in respect to the removal without cause of a director or directors so elected, to the vote of the holders of the outstanding Shares of that class or series or such particular Shareholders, as applicable, and not to the vote of the outstanding Shares as a whole.
 
5
 
 
5.04          Vacancies. Vacancies in the Board occurring by reason of death, resignation, increase in the number of directors, or otherwise, other than removal of a director with or without cause by a vote of the Shareholders, shall be filled by the Shareholders as provided in any Shareholder Agreement. A vacancy that will occur at a specific date, by reason of a resignation effective at a later date or otherwise, may be filled before the vacancy occurs, but the newly elected director may not take office until the vacancy occurs.
 
5.05          Meetings. Meetings of the Board shall be held at such place as may from time to time be fixed by resolution of the Board, or as may be specified in the notice for the applicable meeting or in a waiver of notice thereof. Regular meetings of the Board may be held at the times and places (or by remote communication) that the majority of the directors may from time to time determine at a prior meeting, but in no event shall such meetings be held within the country of Canada. Special meetings of the Board may be called by the Chairperson of the Board (if the office is filled) or the President & CEO, and shall be called by the President & CEO or Secretary in accordance with the written request of any three directors.
 
5.06          Notice of Meetings. Regular and special meetings of the Board shall be convened by not less than three days’ written notice, which may be made through electronic communication and the notice shall state the time, place, and purpose or purposes of the meeting.
 
5.07          Quorum. Subject to the provisions of any Shareholder Agreement, a majority of the Board then in office, or of the members of a Board committee, constitutes a quorum of the Board or such committee, as applicable, for the transaction of business; provided, that to the extent that a vote on any action of the Board or such committee, as applicable, at such meeting requires the approval of a director designated by a particular Shareholder under any Shareholder Agreement, such quorum shall include at least one director designated by such Shareholder; provided, further, that if at any meeting of the Board or such committee there shall be less than a quorum present, a majority of the directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall have been obtained. The vote of a majority of the directors or members of a committee thereof present at any meeting at which there is a quorum constitutes the action of the Board or of the board committee, as applicable, except when a larger vote may be required by the laws of the state of Michigan or the provisions of any Shareholder Agreement; provided, that to the extent that a vote on any action of the Board or such committee at such meeting requires the approval of a director designated by a particular Shareholder under any such Shareholder Agreement, such quorum shall include at least one director designated by such Shareholder. A member of the Board or of a committee designated by the Board may participate in a meeting by conference telephone or other means of remote communication through which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other. Participation in a meeting in this manner constitutes presence in person at the meeting.

5.08          Dissents. A director who is present at a meeting of the Board, or a board committee of which the director is a member, at which action on a corporate matter is taken, is presumed to have concurred in that action unless the director’s dissent is entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless the director files a written dissent to the action with the person acting as secretary of the meeting before the adjournment of it or forwards the dissent by registered mail to the Secretary promptly after the adjournment of the meeting. The right to dissent does not apply to a director who voted in favor of the action. A director who is absent from a meeting of the Board or a board committee of which the director is a member, at which any such action is taken, is presumed to have concurred in the action unless he or she files a written dissent with the Secretary within a reasonable time after the director has knowledge of the action.
 
5.09          Compensation. The Board, by affirmative vote of a majority of directors in office and irrespective of any personal interest of any of them, may establish reasonable compensation of directors for services to the Corporation as directors, committee members or officers. The Board shall also have the power, in its discretion, to reimburse directors for reasonable expenses incurred for attendance at each regular or special meeting of the Board, or of any committee of the Board. In addition, the Board shall also have the power, in its discretion, to provide for and pay to directors rendering services to the Corporation not ordinarily rendered by directors, as such, special compensation appropriate to the value of such services, as determined by the Board from time to time. Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.
 
5.10          Committees. Subject to the provisions of any Shareholders Agreements, the Board may designate from among its members one or more committees which shall consist of one or more directors. The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee to replace an absent or disqualified member at any committee meeting. Such committees shall have and may exercise such powers as shall be conferred or authorized by the resolution appointing them, except to the extent limited by applicable law. A majority of any such committee may determine its action and fix the time and place of its meetings, unless the Board shall otherwise provide; provided, that to the extent that a vote on any action of the board committee at such meeting requires the approval of a director designated by a particular Shareholder under any such Shareholder Agreements, such quorum shall include at least one director designated by such Shareholder. The Board shall have power at any time to change the membership of any such committee, to fill vacancies on or to dissolve any such committee.
 
5.11          Action Without a Meeting. Any action required or permitted at any meeting of directors or a committee of directors may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if all of the directors or committee members entitled to vote on it consent to it in writing or, to the extent permitted by law, by electronic transmission. Such consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board or committee, as applicable.

5.12          Observers. One or more non-voting observers to the Board and/or its committees may be selected by the Shareholders. Any such observer shall hold such position until the observer’s successor is selected, or until the observer’s resignation or removal. An observer may resign by written notice to the Corporation. The resignation is effective on its receipt by the Corporation or at a subsequent time as set forth in the notice of resignation. Subject to the provisions of any Shareholder Agreement, an observer may be removed, with or without cause, by the Shareholders, and thereupon the term of the observer who shall have been so removed shall forthwith terminate. Each observer shall be entitled to attend all meetings (including telephonic meetings) of the Board and the Board’s committees to which it has been granted observer rights. Each observer shall be entitled to receive (x) notices of all meetings of the Board and the Board’s committees to which it has been granted observer rights and (y) all information delivered to the members of the Board and the Board’s committees to which it has been granted observer rights in connection with such meetings, in each case to the extent and at the same time such notice and information is delivered to the members of the Board and its committees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Chairperson of the Board (if the office is filled) or the President & CEO shall (a) excuse any observer from any portion of a Board meeting or a meeting of its committees to the extent such observer’s participation in such meeting is reasonably likely to adversely affect the attorney/client privilege of the Corporation and its legal advisors and (b) withhold information from any observer delivered to the Board and the Board’s committees to which it has been granted observer rights prior to a meeting of the Board or, as the case may be, such committee, in each case if the Chairperson of the Board (if the office is filled) or the President & CEO believes there is a reasonable likelihood that the receipt of such information by the observer may adversely affect the attorney/client privilege of the Corporation and its legal advisors.

6.01          Notices. All notices of meetings required to be given to Shareholders, directors or observers may be given either personally or by mailing the notice to such Shareholder’s address as it appears on the books of the Corporation or at such other address as shall be furnished in writing by such Shareholder to the Corporation for such purpose, or by a form of electronic transmission to which the Shareholder has consented.

(a)            in the case of a Shareholder, unless the Shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, or unless with respect to consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, the Shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is presented; or
 
8
 
 
(b)           in the case of a director, unless he or she at the beginning of the meeting, or upon his or her arrival, objects to the meeting or the transacting of business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to any action taken at the meeting.

10.01      Maintenance of Books and Records. The proper officers and agents of the Corporation shall keep and maintain the books, records, and accounts of the Corporation’s business and affairs, minutes of the proceedings of its Shareholders, Board, and committees, if any, and the stock ledgers and lists of Shareholders, as the Board shall deem advisable and as shall be required by the laws of the state of Michigan and other states or jurisdictions empowered to impose such requirements. Books, records, and minutes may be kept within or without the state of Michigan in a place that the Board shall determine.
 
10.02      Reliance on Books and Records. In discharging his or her duties, a director or an officer of the Corporation, when acting in good faith, may rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by any of the following:
 
11
 
 
(a)            one or more directors, officers, or employees of the Corporation, or of a subsidiary or controlled affiliate of the Corporation, whom the director or officer reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;
 
(b)            legal counsel, public accountants, engineers, or other persons as to matters the director or officer reasonably believes are within the person’s professional or expert competence; or
 
(c)            a committee of the Board, if the director or officer reasonably believes the committee merits confidence.
 
A director or officer is not entitled to rely on the information set forth above if he or she has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes such reliance unwarranted.

A proper purpose shall mean any purpose reasonably related to such person’s interest as a Shareholder. Subject to any Shareholder Agreements, in every instance where an attorney or other agent shall be the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing which authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the Shareholder. The demand shall be directed to the Corporation at its registered office in the State of Michigan or at its principal place of business.
 
ARTICLE XI

INDEMNIFICATION
 
11.01      Indemnification. Subject to all of the other provisions of this Article XI, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party to or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative and whether formal or informal, including any appeal, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or, while serving as a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, member, partner, trustee, employee, fiduciary or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans or public service or charitable organizations, against expenses (including actual and reasonable attorney fees and disbursements), judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement and incurred by him or her in connection with such action, suit, or proceeding, in each case to the maximum extent permitted by the Michigan Business Corporation Act (the “MBCA”). The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or on a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that any person otherwise entitled to indemnification hereunder (a) did not act in good faith and in a manner that the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation or its Shareholders, (b) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful, or (c) received a financial benefit to which he or she is not entitled, intentionally inflicted harm on the Corporation or its Shareholders, violated Section 551 of the MBCA or intentionally committed a criminal act.
 
12
 
 
11.02      Expenses of Successful Defense. To the extent that a director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit, or proceeding referred to in Section 11.01, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter in the action, suit, or proceeding, the director or officer shall be indemnified against actual and reasonable expenses (including attorney fees) incurred by the person in connection with the action, suit, or proceeding and any action, suit, or proceeding brought to enforce the mandatory indemnification provided by this Section 11.02.
 
11.03      Definitions. For purposes of this Article XI only:
 
(a)            “serving at the request of the Corporation” shall include any service as a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation that imposes duties on, or involves services by, the director or officer with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or its beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be considered to have acted in a manner “not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation or its shareholders;” and
 
(b)           “independent director” shall have the meaning set forth in Section 107 of the MBCA.
 
11.04      Contract Right; Limitation on Indemnity. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article XI shall be a contract right and shall apply to services of a director or officer as an employee or agent of the Corporation as well as in the person’s capacity as a director or officer. No amendment of these Bylaws or the Articles of Incorporation shall eliminate or impair a right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses established herein or therein with respect to any action or omission occurring prior to such amendment. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article XI, the Corporation shall have no obligations under this Article XI to indemnify any person in connection with any proceeding, or part thereof, initiated by the person without authorization by the Board.
 
11.05      Determination That Indemnification Is Proper.
 
(a)           Except as provided in Section 11.05(b), any indemnification under Section 11.01 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the person is proper in the circumstances because the person has met the applicable standard of conduct provided by applicable law, and upon an evaluation of the reasonableness of expenses and amounts paid in settlement. The determination and evaluation shall be made in any of the following ways:
 
(1)               by a majority vote of a quorum of the Board consisting of directors who are not parties or threatened to be made parties to the action, suit, or proceeding;
 
13
 
 
(2)               if the quorum described in clause (1) above is not obtainable, then by majority vote of a committee of directors duly designated by the Board and consisting solely of two or more directors who are not at the time parties or threatened to be made parties to the action, suit, or proceeding;
 
(3)               by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, which counsel shall be selected in one of the following ways: (i) by the Board or its committee in the manner prescribed in clause (1) or (2); or (ii) if a quorum of the Board cannot be obtained under clause (1) and a committee cannot be designated under clause (2), by the Board;
 
(4)               by the Shareholders, but Shares held by directors, officers, employees, or agents who are parties or threatened to be made parties to the action, suit, or proceeding may not be voted on the determination or evaluation; or
 
(5)               by all independent directors who are not parties or threatened to be made parties to the action, suit, or proceeding.
 
(b)               If the Articles of Incorporation include a provision eliminating or limiting the liability of a director pursuant to Section 209(1)(c) of the MBCA, the Corporation shall indemnify a director for the expenses and liabilities described in this paragraph without a determination that the director has met the standard of conduct set forth in the MBCA, but no indemnification may be made except to the extent authorized in Section 564c of the MBCA, if the director received a financial benefit to which he or she was not entitled, intentionally inflicted harm on the Corporation or its Shareholders, violated Section 551 of the MBCA, or intentionally violated criminal law. In connection with an action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation, indemnification under this Section 11.05(b) may be for expenses, including attorneys’ fees, actually and reasonably incurred. In connection with an action, suit or proceeding other than one by or in the right of the Corporation, indemnification under this Section 11.05(b) may be for expenses, including attorneys’ fees, actually and reasonably incurred, and for judgments, penalties, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred.
 
11.06      Authorizations of Payment. Authorizations of payment under Section 11.01 shall be made in any of the following ways:
 
(a)            by the Board:
 
(1)               if there are two or more directors who are not parties or threatened to be made parties to the action, suit or proceeding, by a majority vote of all such directors (a majority of whom shall for this purpose constitute a quorum) or by a majority of the members of a committee of two or more directors who are not parties or threatened to be made parties to the action, suit or proceeding;
 
(2)               if the Corporation has one or more independent directors who are not parties or threatened to be made parties to the action, suit or proceeding, by a majority vote of all such directors (a majority of whom shall for this purpose constitute a quorum); or
 
(3)               if there are no independent directors and fewer than two directors who are not parties or threatened to be made parties to the action, suit or proceeding, by the vote necessary for action by the Board in accordance with Section 5.07, in which authorization all directors may participate; or
 
14
 
 
(b)               by the Shareholders, but Shares held by directors, officers, employees, or agents who are parties or threatened to be made parties to the action, suit, or proceeding may not be voted on the authorization.
 
11.07      Proportionate Indemnity. If a person is entitled to indemnification under Section 11.01 for a portion of expenses, including attorney fees, judgments, penalties, fines, and amounts paid in settlement, but not for the total amount, the Corporation shall indemnify the person for the portion of the expenses, judgments, penalties, fines, or amounts paid in settlement for which the person is entitled to be indemnified.
 
11.08      Expense Advance. The Corporation shall pay or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by a person referred to in Section 11.01 who is a party or threatened to be made a party to an action, suit, or proceeding in advance of final disposition (herein, an “advance”) of the proceeding if the person furnishes the Corporation a written undertaking executed personally, or on his or her belief, to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that he or she did not meet the standard of conduct, if any, required by the MBCA for the indemnification of the person under the circumstances. The Corporation shall make an evaluation of reasonableness under this Section 11.08 as specified in Section 11.05, and shall make an authorization in the manner specified in Section 11.06, unless the advance is mandatory. The Corporation may make an authorization of advances with respect to a proceeding and a determination of reasonableness of advances or selection of a method for determining reasonableness in a single action or resolution covering an entire proceeding. A provision in the Articles of Incorporation, these Bylaws, a resolution by the Board or the Shareholders, or an agreement making indemnification mandatory shall also make advancement of expenses mandatory unless the provision specifically provides otherwise.
 
11.09      Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The indemnification or advancement of expenses provided under this Article XI is not exclusive of other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under a contractual arrangement with the Corporation. However, the total amount of expenses advanced or indemnified from all sources combined shall not exceed the amount of actual expenses incurred by the person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses.
 
11.10      Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article XI with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation. Any person serving, or who has served, as a director, officer, trustee or employee of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust, association or other enterprise, at least 50% of whose equity interests or assets are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation (a "subsidiary" for this Article XI) shall be conclusively presumed to be, or to have been, serving in such capacity at the request of the Corporation.
 
15
 
 
11.11      Former Directors and Officers. The indemnification provided in this Article XI continues for a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of the person.
 
11.12      Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against the person and incurred by him or her in any such capacity or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have power to indemnify the person against the liability under these Bylaws or the laws of the state of Michigan. If the Articles of Incorporation include a provision eliminating or limiting the liability of a director pursuant to Section 209(1)(c) of the MBCA, such insurance may be purchased from an insurer owned by the Corporation, but such insurance may insure against monetary liability to the Corporation or its Shareholders only to the extent to which the Corporation could indemnify the director under Section 11.05(b).
 
11.13      Changes in Michigan Law. If there is any change of the Michigan statutory provisions applicable to the Corporation relating to the subject matter of this Article XI, then the indemnification to which any person shall be entitled under this article shall be determined by the changed provisions, but only to the extent that the change permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than the provisions permitted the Corporation to provide before the change. Subject to Section 11.14, the Board is authorized to amend these Bylaws to conform to any such changed statutory provisions.
 
11.14      Amendment or Repeal of Article XI. No amendment or repeal of this Article XI shall apply to or have any effect on any director or officer of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of the director or officer occurring before the amendment or repeal. Persons who after the date of the adoption of this provision become or remain directors or officers of the Corporation or who, while a director or officer of the Corporation, become or remain a director, officer, employee or agent of a subsidiary, shall be conclusively presumed to have relied on the rights to indemnity, advance of expenses and other rights contained in this Article XI in entering into or continuing such service. The rights to indemnification and to the advance of expenses conferred in this Article XI shall apply to claims made against an indemnitee arising out of acts or omissions which occurred or occur both prior and subsequent to the adoption hereof.
 
11.15      Enforcement of Rights. Any determination with respect to indemnification or payment in advance of final disposition under this Article XI shall be made promptly, and in any event within thirty days, after written request to the Corporation by the person seeking such indemnification or payment. If it is determined that such indemnification or payment is proper and if such indemnification or payment is authorized (to the extent such authorization is required) in accordance with this Article XI, then such indemnification or payment in advance of final disposition under this Article XI shall be made promptly, and in any event within thirty days after such determination has been made, such authorization that may be required has been given and any conditions precedent to such indemnification or payment set forth in this Article XI, the Articles of Incorporation or applicable law have been satisfied. The rights granted by this Article XI shall be enforceable by such person in any court of competent jurisdiction.
